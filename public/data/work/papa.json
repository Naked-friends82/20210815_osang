      "One of Sangmin’s storytelling objects “PAPA” evokes a special memory between him and his father. Alongside his father’s one of the essential rituals at home that is watering the plants, Sangmin designs a watering can which reminds his father that they are together. The design stems from mutual body stretching whenever they went hiking.",
      "“My dad came home once a week because of work. I was rarely able to see him due to school when he comes. So, I wanted to give him a special object which makes him recalling our memories. With this watering can, I hope he finds a small happiness while watering the plants.” says Sangmin."
